//! Interactive fuzzy selection, built in via [`skim`].
//!
//! The fuzzy finder is compiled into the binary — there is no `fzf` subprocess.
//! Every place that asks the user to choose goes through here.
//!
//! Items carry a separate [`SelectItem::label`] (shown and fuzzy-matched) and
//! value (returned on selection), so the selector can show a `~`-collapsed path
//! while still returning an absolute one.
//!
//! Rows arrive either all at once ([`select_one`], [`select_many`]) or as they
//! are discovered ([`select_one_streamed`], [`select_many_streamed`]).

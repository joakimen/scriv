//! What a shell can be told to do on a key or under a name.
//!
//! `scriv init` writes shell code, and which code it writes is configuration:
//! `[shell.bindings]` maps a key to an action and `[shell.aliases]` maps a
//! name to one. Neither holds shell code — an action is a scriv command plus
//! what the shell does with what it prints, and each shell's emitter knows how
//! to say that in its own language. That is what keeps one table serving every
//! shell scriv learns to write for.
//!
//! I/O-free: [`resolve`] turns the configuration into the list an emitter
//! walks, and refuses a name no action answers to.

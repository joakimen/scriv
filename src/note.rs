//! Notes: a tree of Markdown files — an Obsidian vault, or anything shaped like
//! one — read as rows in a selector.
//!
//! Everything here is pure. The walk, the file reads and the clock live in
//! [`cmd::note`](crate::cmd::note); this module turns the bytes they hand back
//! into a title, a set of tags, two dates, an aligned row and a rendered
//! preview.
//!
//! A note says what it is in its YAML front matter, which is the only metadata
//! this reads. Inline `#tags` in the body are deliberately not indexed: finding
//! them means scanning every byte of every note and then telling a tag apart
//! from a heading, a colour literal and a URL fragment, and a tag column that is
//! right most of the time is worse than one that is right always.

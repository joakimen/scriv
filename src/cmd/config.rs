//! `scriv config` — generate, print and check the configuration file.
//!
//! `print` and `check` answer different questions and are kept apart on
//! purpose. `print` is the configuration: every setting there is, what is in
//! force for it, and whether that came from the file or from scriv. `check` is
//! a checklist: whether what the settings point at is actually there, and
//! whether the programs scriv shells out to are installed. A row in `check`
//! repeats a value only where repeating it is the way out of a problem.

/// A commented starter config. Settings are grouped by the command that reads
/// them; users edit it to taste.
const TEMPLATE: &str = r#"# scriv configuration. Settings are grouped by the command that reads them,
# with `[selector]` — shared by every selector — at the end.

# `scriv repo`: where your repositories are, and how they are labelled.
[repo]

# Every repository lives under one root, laid out as <owner>/<repo> — the same
# shape as GitHub itself. `repo clone` writes here, so a clone always lands
# somewhere `repo sel` will find it.
root = "~/dev/github.com"

# Repositories outside the root, listed one at a time. An escape hatch for
# checkouts that predate the layout; `clone` never writes here.
# extra = ["~/bin"]

# Directory names to skip while searching.
ignore = ["node_modules", "target"]

# How repository paths are rendered: relative | tilde | full
# display = "relative"

# Labels name owners, one label to many owners, so everything you touch for work
# colours as one group in the selector however many orgs it spans. An owner with
# no label still shows up — just uncoloured.
#
# Written inline, on one line, so it stays an ordinary `[repo]` key: a
# `[repo.labels]` header would swallow every `[repo]` key written after it.
# labels = { personal = ["your-github-user"], work = ["acme", "acme-labs"] }

# `scriv worktree`: where `worktree add` creates a tree.
[worktree]

# One directory per branch, with `/` written as `-`. A relative path is inside
# the repository the tree belongs to, and is added to that clone's
# .git/info/exclude the first time, so nothing else offers the tree twice. An
# absolute path holds the trees of every repository, under the repository's own
# name.
# root = ".worktrees"

# `scriv note`: where your notes are, and what opens one.
[note]

# The directory holding them — an Obsidian vault, or any tree of Markdown
# files. Notes below it are listed most recently modified first, and what each
# one is called, which tags it carries and when it was created come from its
# YAML front matter. Without this, `scriv note` has nowhere to look.
# root = "~/notes"

# Labels for the directories directly below the root, one label to many
# directories — the same idea as `[repo] labels`, and the same colours, so
# `work` reads the same in both. A directory with no label still shows up in
# the label column, under its own name and uncoloured.
#
# Written inline, on one line, for the reason `[repo] labels` is.
# labels = { work = ["projects", "clients"], personal = ["journal"] }

# The one permanent note `note scratch` opens — somewhere to put a thought
# without deciding first whether it is worth a note of its own. A path below
# the root; its directory is created the first time.
# scratch = "scratch/scratch.md"

# What `note edit` launches, split on whitespace like $EDITOR. Its own setting
# because a note is as often read as written — `glow` and `nvim` are both
# answers. Unset, it is $VISUAL then $EDITOR, as `scriv edit` uses.
# editor = "nvim"

# `scriv history`: which shell history to search.
[history]

# fish's history file. The default is $XDG_DATA_HOME/fish/fish_history, falling
# back to ~/.local/share/fish/fish_history. Set this only if you have named your
# session — `set -U fish_history work` reads `work_history` instead — since fish
# does not export that variable for scriv to find.
# file = "~/.local/share/fish/work_history"

# `scriv init`: what the shell integration defines.
#
# Neither table holds shell code — each names an action scriv defines, so the
# same configuration serves fish and any shell scriv later learns to write for.
# Between them the two tables below name every action there is. `scriv config
# print` lists the keys and names you have with what each one runs, and `scriv
# config check` says whether they resolve.
#
# A table written here replaces the defaults rather than adding to them, which
# is how a key is unbound or a name dropped: leave it out. Both tables below are
# the defaults exactly, so uncommenting one and editing it changes only what you
# edited. Leaving them commented keeps whatever scriv ships.
#
# Keys are spelled as fish spells them.
# [shell.bindings]
# ctrl-o = "repo-cd"          # cd to a repository
# ctrl-t = "worktree-cd"      # cd to a worktree of this repository
# f1     = "repo-open"        # open a repository on GitHub
# f2     = "pr-open"          # open this branch's pull request, or the list

//! `scriv edit` — fuzzy-find a file or a directory and open it in your editor.
//!
//! Unlike the other groups, this one is not a registry over a set scriv
//! maintains: `file` and `dir` name what is being *looked for* in the tree the
//! user is standing in, so neither has an `ls`. `--tracked` is the one
//! exception, pointing `file` at the known-files list instead.
//!
//! Nothing here needs shell integration: running an editor works perfectly well
//! from a child process, and `cd` is what [`crate::cmd::repo`] is for.

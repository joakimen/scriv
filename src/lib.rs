//! `scriv` — select repositories, files, notes, git branches and worktrees,
//! GitHub pull requests and running processes from one fuzzy finder, and build
//! and install the project you are standing in.
//!
//! The crate is split into an I/O-free core and an imperative shell: the
//! [`cmd`] modules read the environment, touch the filesystem, shell out to
//! `git`/`gh`, and drive interactive selection; everything else is pure.
//! [`Ctx`] resolves the environment once and hands it to every command.

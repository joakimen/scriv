Refusing: HEAD is `main`, and this commit would land on it directly.

CLAUDE.md: "Never commit straight to `main`. The pull request is what leaves a
reviewable record of work nobody watched happen."

Only a commit whose every staged path ends in `.md` is exempt, and this one
does not qualify — stage the Markdown on its own, or put the work on a branch.
Anything larger than a one-line fix gets its own worktree:

    git worktree add .claude/worktrees/<name> -b <name>

If this really has to go on main, run the commit outside Claude Code.
